# Patterns-for-Improvisation
Created for my Spring 2020 Music Technology transfer portfolio, this is an ever-evolving (and soon to be more interactive) texture of synths.

To use this program, first download SuperCollider (you can find it at supercollider.github.io), then download patterns for improvisation.scd and run it. Follow the instructions at the top of the file. They are pasted here, too for convenience:

Thanks for checking out my second SuperCollider project! This one is still very much under construction, but I think it can still make some pretty cool sounds.

To use it, place your cursor to the right of the first "(" and then press ctrl + Enter, or cmd + Enter. A window will open in the middle of your screen. With some buttons:

- Press "New Texture" to start the sound. Press it again to change the mode and randomize some elements.
    - Each time your press this button, you should hear the tonic of whatever the next mode will be.

- Press "Stop" to let the sound fade away.

That's it! There's more to come later. I'm planning on adding more detailed controls so you can change elements on your own, instead of everything being randomized. I'm also planning on adding more sounds so not all of the options sound the same.
